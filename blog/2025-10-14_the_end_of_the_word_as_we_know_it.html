<div id="blog-content"><p>Oct 14</p><h1 id="its-the-end-of-the-word-as-we-know-it">it's the end of the word as we know it</h1><blockquote>
<p><em>in the beginning was the word, and the word was with god, and the word was god. (john 1, new testament, the bible)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>in the beginning, or so we are told, there was the word. or was it… in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth? either way, whatever someone said about the beginning, it was said with words… <a href="https://johnkingcave.bandcamp.com/track/my-words-7">words, words, words…</a> but perhaps that is not quite right.</p><p>for all our centuries of speaking, there have been few who truly questioned the strange architecture we inhabit — a house of words built on silence. language, for all its beauty, is also a veil. every time we name something, we draw a line around it. every word divides. and yet, it’s through these divisions that we try to touch the whole.  </p><p>actually, the word “word” referred to in john 1 comes from the greek <em>logos</em>, meaning “thought.” it would be more accurate to say: <strong><em>in the beginning was the thought, and the thought was with god, and the thought was god.</em></strong></p><p>but what is thought, apart from the word "thought"? (and indeed, <a href="https://voetica.com/poem/5837">what is the word</a> “god” apart from god?) this is the profound and essential question — and one that words can only point toward but never resolve. we might say thought is awareness. yet what is awareness apart from the word “awareness”? is it "thought"? you see the impossibility of defining the thing itself without using another word. at a certain point, words become useless — a snake eating its own tail — and there is only one way to truly understand: to abandon the search using words. for as lao tzu said, <em>the tao that can be spoken is not the true tao</em>, and ludwig wittgenstein: <em>that which cannot be said must not be said.</em></p><p>the word <em>word</em> itself assumes that reality can be divided into that which is word-based, and that which is not. as we see it, the development of language and our dependence on it across “human civilizations” has justified countless misunderstandings of the one — which came before words, exists even within them, and will remain long after they fade. krishnamurti once declared, <a href="https://kfoundation.org/dissolution-speech/">“truth is a pathless land.”</a> i would take this one step further: truth is a <em>wordless</em> path.</p><p>everywhere we go, we are bombarded by the constant noise of separational language — a world (indeed, the word in clever disguise) filled to the brim with “individuals” “pursuing their own goals,” “driving their cars,” “pursuing their careers,” “following their dreams,” “making ends meet,” and “advancing in society.” we categorize, label, and rank ourselves and others, constantly comparing and contrasting, using words to mark hierarchies, differences, and distances. even the phrase <em>self-help</em> is implicitly framed as an egoic pursuit — as though helping the self were somehow distinct from helping all selves. the so-called law is a function of language, a structure of words that defines what is permissible, what is forbidden, and who is accountable, yet even law is only a map of our separational thinking, not the territory of oneness.  </p><p>we frame our lives in narratives of success and failure, right and wrong, mine and yours, as though the boundaries we draw with language were real, rather than constructs. through the eyes of one, these distinctions are meaningless. if we are to help at all, it must be help for all (in whatever form all takes) — otherwise our service is limited, exclusionary, and rooted in separation.  </p><p>so what, then, is the solution? are we to abandon words altogether? perhaps not quite yet. but the evolution of language seems to follow a natural arc — one that moves from division toward unity, from noise toward silence.  </p><p>we forsee the end of the word unfolding in three broad stages:</p><h3 id="1-the-revolutionary-reclaiming-of-language">1. the revolutionary reclaiming of language</h3><p>the first stage is already underway: the reclaiming of language in service of unity. this means using pronouns interchangeably, softening the possessive “my,” reimagining subject and object, dismantling the power structures that language enshrines. when we speak with awareness, we begin to bend words back toward their origin — to make them transparent to the silence beneath. language becomes less about naming things and more about evoking presence. words become fingers pointing toward what cannot be said.  </p><h3 id="2-the-recognition-of-the-limits-of-words">2. the recognition of the limits of words</h3><p>the second stage will be marked by a widespread understanding of the limits of language. we will begin to see that words are not the carriers of meaning but shadows of it. communication will evolve into resonance — meaning felt, not spoken. we already see glimpses of this in music, in art, in the silent understanding between lovers or between human and animal. true communication does not occur in sentences but in shared being. the so-called “telepathic” evolution of higher intelligence may simply be this: a refinement of perception so subtle that words become unnecessary.  </p><h3 id="3-the-abandonment-or-transfiguration-of-words">3. the abandonment (or transfiguration) of words</h3><p>the third stage — the end of the word as we know it — will not be a silencing but a flowering into silence and direct energetic expression. words will be used only to reach those still dwelling in the separational mind, just as teachers once used parables for children. for those awake to the whole, communication will occur in perfect understanding, instant and effortless.  </p><p>even these very ideas, which now sound speculative or strange, will one day seem self-evident — the way early humans once found the notion of writing inconceivable. to those who come after, our current speech will sound like the babble of infants: beautiful, earnest, but limited. and yet, there will still be poetry. for the poet will remain — the one who remembers the silence before words and translates it into form. the poet will speak not instead of silence but from it, the poetry itself serving as an instantaneous ecstatic transmission of shared awareness arising from a unified mind.  </p><p>and maybe that’s what we’re doing already, right now — on the trembling threshold of a new speech, where the word begins to remember its own end.  </p><p>have you ever sat in presence with another — without speaking, without naming — and felt a current of perfect understanding? have you ever looked into the eyes of an animal, a child, a lover, and felt that no language could add to what is already known? this is communication without translation, comprehension without category. it is what words have always been straining toward, and what silence has always contained.</p><p>let us attempt to speak less and express more. let us remember that the deepest understanding and joy arises not from sentences, but from presence, from attention, from the shared thought beyond words.  </p><p><center>may these words help you forget them once and for all.</center>
<center>with infinite love, thank you.</center></p></div>
