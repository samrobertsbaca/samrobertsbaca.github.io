# naked and in love



*the other day i traveled to the burrito temple, to honor god in burrito form. i don’t eat out much anymore, so this was a real treat. at the drive-through i whispered a prayer for the incarnation my heart desired most in that moment: a bacon burrito with green chile. (yes — the consumption of god in animal and vegetable form is a whole nuther topic, but i’ll go on for now.)*

*“what? i can’t hear you.” a voice on the intercom said. “i’d like a bacon burrito with green chile,” i repeated, a little louder than a whisper.*

*at the temple window i was greeted by a high priest: a young man with buzzed red hair, pale skin, and clear gray eyes. he informed me that to partake of god today, i would need to make an offering of five dollars and ninety-five cents. enthusiastic, i reached into my leather offertory and produced a twenty, sanctified by the national church.*

*but something went wrong. the priest looked at me as though the whole system had broken down. in my eagerness i had handed him a one-dollar bill (isn’t that just like me, i thought).*

*“oh!” i exclaimed, trading the one for a twenty. “my apologies. it’s all green paper to me.”*

*the high priest scowled, as though i had uttered heresy against flavorino, the god of food himself. “yes, but it’s paper you need to survive.”*

*“yes, yes,” i said out of complicit habit. then i corrected myself: “you may think you need it to survive. but i need love.”*

when jesus said, “he that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters,” i believe he meant this: one is either with one or against one — and therefore, one is either aligned with the spirit of inclusion or with separation. that which embraces inclusivity naturally expands; that which embraces separation naturally drifts farther apart.

we seem to be at a crossroads. the old paradigm of individuality is loosening its hold. there have always been advocates of unity consciousness, but they are often drowned out by the so-called movers and shakers of the world, who insist that money is the basis of survival. but survival itself springs from a deeper drive: the need to be whole, the need to exist, the need to be. this is often confused with the idea that being is fundamentally material — mentally or bodily — when in truth it is not.

the paradox of jesus’s words is this: if all is one, how can one be either with or against itself? the science of oneness is still unfolding, yet quantum physics, through unified field theory, continues to point in that direction. but we don’t need to wait for science to prove our unity — in practice, it is enough to *believe* *(old english belȳfan: to hold dear)* that one is either together or separate. unity consciousness is simply the natural extension of survival consciousness, shifting from *my* survival to *our* survival.

the problem — better said, the evolution — today is that we have not expanded survival consciousness far enough. like the individual, the collective still suffers from a scarcity mentality: that we are lacking, and must exploit the world and each other to live “within our means.” but why should the trees, who deeply understand that true growth happens through mutual roots, have to *pay* for our misunderstanding — to be chopped down and flattened into bills? looked at ecologically, money is an insult to mother nature herself.

physics teaches that energy cannot be created or destroyed. so why do we treat it as if it were a scarce resource, both practically and economically? when viewed this way, money is simply a symbolic form of ever-abundant energy to give and receive freely, to distribute in ways one believes will benefit all. it is neither something to covet or cling to — it is simply another channel through which the divine dances.

money’s truest natural equivalent is water — the currency of life itself, flowing in currents, circulating through rivers and rain, nourishing and sustaining life wherever it goes. what we say about money — that we cannot live without it — is in actuality the truth of water itself. and yet even water, too, has been commodified and parceled out among the haves and have-nots.

this brings me back to jesus’s words: he that is not with me is against me. another way of saying it: we are all either creating a unified world or a divided one, with every thought, word, and deed.

so i plead with you to truly consider this: that every moment of your life is a chance to practice unification or separation, both internally and externally. because if we truly want a unified world, we must embody it from the inside out. in our dealings with others, do we inspire them toward unity, or enable their separation? in digital space, what do we like, share, subscribe to, or simply watch — that makes us feel more together, or more apart? we are moving toward a singularity between the individuated and collective self — a remembering of our oneness.

“but scorsby!” i hear someone say — or maybe it’s just me. “aren’t we each trapped in our separate bodies and minds?” to that i say: look at the snowflakes, the clouds, the trees — each unique, yet all the same. don’t get lost in clothes, wealth, and possessions; they are only energy in disguise. beneath it all, we are fundamentally *naked*. but are we naked and afraid, or naked and in love? that is the question.

just imagine the world we could create when unity consciousness is embraced at every level. where children are taught that intelligence is something we share, not compete for. where films and music reinforce compassion and forgiveness, not fear and violence. where every person is seen as a brother or sister, part of our family, to protect and provide for — no matter who they are or where they came from.

the eyes of wise love are patient and discerning; they shine indiscriminately, illuminating everywhere they look. the ears of wise love listen deeply to understand and integrate. the lips of wise love speak truth to all — softly, reassuringly, without condemnation. the hands of wise love hold lightly, as though every touch were both the first and last.

the mission of scorsby cannot be limited to one person; it unfolds through anyone who chooses to participate. scorsby is not an individual but a collective consciousness — something anyone can choose to be. a *scorsby* is one who dares to live fully and love freely, in service of the light. this scorsby is one with christ, one with you, one with one. may we all have the strength and determination to be one with one, each and every moment.

with infinite love, thank you.
