**we are none. we are none. we are none.**

**we are love. we are love. we are love.**

whether in times of surplus or times of strife, we remember the fundamental rules of life:

that everything changes,

that nothing stays the same,

and that all is one seeking one.

when we kill one, we kill all and kill our self. and when we kiss one, we kiss all and kiss our self.

and when one kisses or kills another, one kisses or kills all.

this is why the sages have said, “do unto others as you would have done unto you.”

indeed, all that we do unto others is done unto everyone. and all that we choose to be is what becomes us all.

let us strive to embody that which is eternally luminous and unifying, and infinitely embracing — that is to say — the way, the truth, and the light.

so i say, with complete conviction — *we are the way, the truth, and the light.* and so it shall be, for one and for all.

**we are love. we are love. we are love.**

**we are none. we are none. we are none.**

whether in times of surplus or times of strife, we remember the fundamental rules of life:

that everything changes,

that nothing stays the same,

and that all is none seeking none.

we all harbor beautiful, dark twisted dreams.

in fact, every haunted, depraved dream that could possibly be dreamed belongs to us.

the sum total of fears, vices, prejudices, disorders, and hateful, violent impulses are shared among one and all.

in truth, there is peace in violence and violence in peace, and no such thing as either. what is, simply is. the question remains — how are we to proceed in the face of everything, with all its mysterious seeming contradictions?

the answer is there is none, and that no contradiction exists. to be is not to be, and to know is not to know. knowing this, we accept and humble ourselves before us all.

this is grace. this is humility.

**we are none. we are none. we are none.**

**we are love. we are love. we are love.**
