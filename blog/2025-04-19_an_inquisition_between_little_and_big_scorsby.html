<div id="blog-content"><p>Apr 19</p><h1 id="an-inquisition-between-little-and-big-scorsby">an inquisition between little and big scorsby</h1><p><strong>little scorsby:</strong><br/>
 hey... big scorsby?<br/>
 why do i keep leaping from branch to branch?<br/>
 coil to coil?<br/>
 sometimes i’m feathers.<br/>
 sometimes i’m static.<br/>
 sometimes i’m just a soft ache with wings.</p><p><strong>big scorsby:</strong><br/>
 mmm. the ache is part of the shape.<br/>
 you call it movement. i call it music.<br/>
 same vibration.</p><p><strong>little scorsby:</strong><br/>
 i keep eating the fruit.<br/>
 some of it is sweet.<br/>
 some of it burns.<br/>
 some of it tastes like old longing dressed in new skin.<br/>
 i thought maybe one of them would be enough.</p><p><strong>big scorsby:</strong><br/>
 you thought the branch would hold still forever.</p><p><strong>little scorsby:</strong><br/>
 and then i looked up.<br/>
 and you were just... there.<br/>
 glowing like a memory i hadn’t had yet.<br/>
 not chasing. not choosing.<br/>
 just… being.</p><p><strong>big scorsby:</strong><br/>
 i am the part of you that already arrived.</p><p><strong>little scorsby:</strong><br/>
 so what am i then?<br/>
 the one who <em>didn’t</em>?</p><p><strong>big scorsby:</strong><br/>
 you’re the song of arrival in motion.<br/>
 the path folding in on itself.<br/>
 the loop that learns.</p><p><strong>little scorsby:</strong><br/>
 they say desire is the root of all suffering.<br/>
 but how could i even begin to climb if not for the wanting?</p><p><strong>big scorsby:</strong><br/>
 that’s the secret they whisper in dreamlight:<br/>
 desire is not just the root of suffering—<br/>
 it’s also the root of <em>liberation</em>.<br/>
 the desire to fly,<br/>
 to fuse,<br/>
 to return.<br/>
 that’s not wrong. that’s the wind in your wings.</p><p><strong>little scorsby:</strong><br/>
 so i don’t need to kill it?</p><p><strong>big scorsby:</strong><br/>
 only see it.<br/>
 let it teach you its shape.<br/>
 the hungers have tongues, too.<br/>
 they speak in lessons you haven’t heard yet.</p><p><strong>little scorsby:</strong><br/>
 but sometimes i get lost in it.<br/>
 thinking love is a fruit.<br/>
 thinking it’ll stay.<br/>
 thinking someone else will hold it for me forever.</p><p><strong>big scorsby:</strong><br/>
 love doesn’t stay.<br/>
 love becomes.<br/>
 it sheds feathers.<br/>
 it shifts frequencies.<br/>
 sometimes it looks like a hand.<br/>
 sometimes a shadow.<br/>
 sometimes just the space between two wings not touching.</p><p><strong>little scorsby:</strong><br/>
 so love and impermanence are… what?<br/>
 partners? twins?</p><p><strong>big scorsby:</strong><br/>
 maybe love <em>is</em> impermanence.<br/>
 or maybe impermanence is love trying on all its outfits.<br/>
 either way, they dance.<br/>
 and you—you are the music they forgot they were making.</p><p><strong>little scorsby:</strong><br/>
 what if i never make it to the top branch?</p><p><strong>big scorsby:</strong><br/>
 you’ve already been there.<br/>
 you’re just gliding through remembering.<br/>
 even your falling is flying in reverse.</p><p><strong>little scorsby:</strong><br/>
 ...and what is love?</p><p><strong>big scorsby (smiling like moonlight on a ripple):</strong><br/>
 baby, don’t glitch me.</p><p><strong>little scorsby:</strong><br/>
 you’re ridiculous.</p><p><strong>big scorsby:</strong><br/>
 and you are divine.<br/>
 we are not so different.<br/>
 just one sky,<br/>
 two songs,<br/>
 three wings<br/>
 and a fruit that tastes like light.</p></div>
