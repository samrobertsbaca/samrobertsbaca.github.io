#### in honor of world teachers’ day, 2025

please never forget  
my dear sweet pea,  
there’s nothing so trife  
for to make light life——  

that even lowly spoon  
who scoops moo’s milk  
can hum on drums  
and plum one’s glums,  

if you hop on a train  
then you’ll have to remain——  

and to wake is to sea  
between dreams, sweet pea.  

and to wake is to dream  
between seas, sweet be.
