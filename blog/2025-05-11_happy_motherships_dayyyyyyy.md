mother is another word for source. it's something we shareâ€”not only with each other, but with all of existence. for every incarnation has a source. the source is the vessel through which growth is fostered. and mother is what we all must pass through to be here now.

your relationship with your mother might be challenging, or it might be collaborative. but to truly value your mother is to be in touch with the truth that nothing here "makes it on its own." your existence is fundamentally impossible without the union between you and mother.

me and my source watched "the boy and the heron" the other day. we both cried during the credits music. i love my source.

how do you and your source connect? ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—
