<div id="blog-content"><p>Mar 24</p><h1 id="make-love-always">make love always</h1><p><img alt="" src="/images/communion.png"/></p><p>i met an angel once at a local taco establishment. actually it was yesterday. he was the cashier, hidden in plain sight. i ordered two pancakes — though it wasn’t a pancake place, they had them — and as he handed me my change, i told him, <strong>"you’re going to be a big success."</strong> he smiled, a knowing smile, the kind that holds something deeper, something unseen. and in that moment, i understood: <strong>all of life is seeking beglonging.</strong></p><p>from the motion of the planets to the way hands reach for each other in the dark, from the tide’s endless return to shore to the breath that leaves and enters our lungs, everything longs to be joined, to dissolve its separateness, to come home.</p><h3 id="the-sacred-current-of-life-energy">the sacred current of life energy</h3><p>life energy is always moving through us, a current that does not belong to us alone but to the great rhythm of existence itself. it is the force behind every heartbeat, every inhale, every act of creation.</p><p>desire in its many forms — yearning for connection, for understanding, for meaning — is not merely of the body, nor is it confined to fleeting moments of pleasure. it is the echo of a cosmic pull, the same force that brings the sky to kiss the horizon at dusk. this energy is not simply about individual fulfillment; it is a divine act of giving, a remembering of oneness. whether it flows through a touch, a gaze, a whispered word, or the quiet pulse of solitude, it is always reaching, always offering, always seeking to complete a circle.</p><h3 id="the-heart-bridge">the heart bridge</h3><p>to truly engage with this energy is to recognize that it does not move in isolation. it is not only a force of body or mind, but of <strong>the heart</strong>— the center where love transforms longing into something sacred. without the heart, desire can become restless hunger. with the heart, it becomes a path to wholeness, a gift freely given, a recognition of the divine in ourselves and in another.</p><p>this is why conscious connection — whether in the presence of another or in the embrace of one’s own being — is not about control, repression, or indulgence. it is about <strong>attunement</strong>. it is about learning to feel the energy rise, to welcome it as one welcomes the wind through an open window, and to guide it not just toward momentary fulfillment but toward deeper connection, toward love, toward spirit.</p><h3 id="the-art-of-circulating-energy">the art of circulating energy</h3><p>some traditions teach that this energy can be cultivated, refined, and shared — not just expended, but transformed. one such practice is <strong>spinal breathing</strong>, where one draws energy from the base of the spine up to the third eye with each inhale, then allows it to cascade back down with the exhale. another is the sacred pause, the act of holding energy before release, letting it fill every part of one’s being before offering it outward like light from a flame.</p><p>but techniques alone are not the essence. the essence is intention. the essence is love. the essence is knowing that in every exchange — physical, emotional, energetic — we are engaging in the great rhythm of giving and receiving, the cosmic dance of coming together and letting go.</p><h3 id="life-is-love-making">life is love making</h3><p>in truth, all of life is love making. every creation, every meeting of souls, every touch of sound against silence, every moment where something separate dissolves into something greater — it is all the same holy act. the angel at the taco stand knew this. he didn’t need wings or a glowing halo. he just needed to take my pancake order and hear those words spoken aloud: <strong>"you’re going to be a big success."</strong></p><p>may we move with grace in that direction. may we give freely. may we love well. may we rejoice in the <strong>beglonging</strong> that was never truly lost.</p></div>
