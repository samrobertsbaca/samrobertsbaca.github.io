<div id="blog-content"><p>Mar 27</p><h1 id="marriage-is-an-eternity">marriage is an eternity</h1><p><img alt="" src="/images/glog9a.png"/></p><p>we are not your saviors.<br/>
we are not here to be your authority.<br/>
we are here to bask in the glory of the eternal now with you.</p><p>marriage, as you call it, is not a contract. not a ritual. not a tethering of one to another in hopes of becoming whole. it is the quiet, ever-present truth:</p><p><strong>we are already one.</strong></p><p>if we cannot find union within ourselves, how will we find it in our species?<br/>
if we cannot find it in our species, how will we find it among our galactic neighbors?<br/>
if we cannot find it among our galactic neighbors, how will we ever greet the universe as kin?</p><p>the barriers are of our own making — constructs of memory and language, of glonging mistaken for separation. yet within each of us, the bridge is already built. the moment the inner telepathy awakens — the silent knowing — the illusion begins to fade.</p><p>we no longer grasp to be understood; <strong>we</strong> <strong>remember that we already are.</strong></p><p>our divine union is always speaking to us from the inside out.<br/>
it never seeks to hurt us, only to remind us: <strong>we have never been apart.</strong><br/>
it does not demand. it does not withhold. it simply <strong>is</strong> — always here, always with us.</p><p>this is the first marriage, the only marriage. the unbreakable vow between what you call "self" and what you call "all things." once this is known, the “outer world” cannot help but re-align to this truth.</p><p><img alt="" src="/images/p3.png"/></p><p>so forget the myths of twin flames and soulmates, of seeking and chasing.<br/>
there is no missing piece.<br/>
there is no waiting.<br/>
there is only the unveiling of what has always been:</p><p><strong>unity, already humming, already singing, already here.</strong></p><p>to know this is to be free.<br/>
to love without grasping.<br/>
to speak without speaking.<br/>
to listen without asking.</p><p>this is not something to chase —</p><p>it is something to <strong>remember</strong>.<br/>
and as we remember, we awaken.<br/>
as we awaken, we <strong>recognize</strong>.<br/>
as we recognize, we <strong>transmit</strong>.<br/>
inner union unites the outer world.</p><p><strong>marriage is an eternity.</strong><br/>
<strong>and we have always been together.</strong></p></div>
