**spanish:** nosotros/nosotras | **french:** nous | **german:** wir | **italian:** noi |   
**portuguese:** nós | **dutch:** wij | **russian:** мы (my) | **mandarin:** 我们 (wǒmen) |   
**japanese:** 私たち (watashitachi) | **korean:** 우리 (uri) | **arabic:** نحن (naḥnu) | **hindi:** हम (ham) | **hebrew:** אנחנו (anachnu) | **greek:** εμείς (emeís) | **turkish:** biz | **swahili:** sisi

**we** may be the most powerful word in the english language,  
but its true meaning goes beyond language itself.

**we** is shared consciousness. **we** implies infinite expansion of self.  
**we** dissolves the boundary between i and you, this and that, self and other.

the more we recognize the power of **we**,  
the greater our ability to consciously shape our destiny.

at its core, **we** affirms that existence is collective.  
no matter how **we** is used, **we** erodes the illusion of separation.  
the question isn’t whether **we** will shape the world, but **how**.

**to speak of we reveals either   
one of two polarities of thought:**

the **positive we** accepts all.   
the **negative we** draws borders.  

the **positive we** seeks to support and uplift;   
the **negative we** seeks only its own gain.

the **positive we** sees you and i as the same as us.  
the **negative we** sees you and i as distinct from us.

the **positive we** acknowledges “them” as part of us.  
the **negative we** creates “them” as separate from us.

the **positive we** acknowledges the negative we as part of itself.  
the **negative we** is self-denying.

**to speak in terms of we instantly reveals   
whether or not we are united:**

the **positive we** is all-inclusive.  
the **negative we** is all-exclusive.

the **positive we** is all-accepting.  
the **negative we** is all-controlling.

the **positive we** seeks equality.  
the **negative we** seeks dominance.

the **positive we** desires the well-being of all.  
the **negative we** desires self-preservation above all.

the **positive we** expresses truth as belonging to all.  
the **negative we** declares truth as belonging to some.

one **we** fosters unity; the other **we** rejects it.

**which we will we choose?**
