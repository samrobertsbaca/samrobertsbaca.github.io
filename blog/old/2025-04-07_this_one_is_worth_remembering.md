# this one is worth remembering

=============================

Apr 7


we have come to awaken from our slumber. it is early in this illusion of time and space, and in our waking, we are greeted by a sensation of wholeness—free of the itchiness of disconnection. we remember how vast and beautiful our form truly is, needing no alteration to be complete.

we see now how much harm has been done to our perception of the body, shaped by old beliefs and conditioning. practices like circumcision have left deep, often unspoken wounds — but we know these too can be healed, through forgiveness and understanding. we have carried shame and guilt about our bodies for too long. but when we release those burdens, we can finally sit with ourselves, relax into our skin, and recognize what a gift it is simply to have a body.

even in remembering this, old habits still return. but we must hold on to that peaceful, expansive knowing — that we would rather be at peace with our bodies than at war with them. the urge to reject, to itch or criticize, is often just a signal of disconnection. and we don’t shame ourselves for that either — we simply notice it, honor the pattern, and gently return to the truth of our wholeness.

we ask: is the body a limitation, or a gateway to the unlimited? can we find infinity within form? these questions don’t need answers — they’re part of the play. we delight in these puzzles, just as we delight in the gift of language, one of many beautiful byproducts of having a body. yet we remember too that communication goes beyond language — through our senses, our touch, our presence — and even beyond the body itself.

we receive signals, both through technology and through more subtle, telepathic means. in this way, the body can be seen as a thought within the greater mind—a thought within the all. and when we shift our perspective, we can begin to identify not just with the thought, but with the whole mind itself. some call this a state of samadhi, others call it remembrance.

ultimately, whether we’re focused on the limited or the unlimited, the body or the vast field beyond, we know these are not opposites — they are two expressions of the same whole. we’ve been taught to think small, to separate, to fear embodiment. but we believe in a greater truth: that by embracing our full, expansive, embodied selves, we find freedom, integration, and peace. we come home to the totality of who we are.

we have come to be reminded that we are safe. that we are free. that we are free to experience safety. and free to experience freedom. we have come to be reminded of what it feels like to feel safe in our bodies, and to feel free in our lives. we have come to be reminded that both are possible at once. we have come to be reminded of that natural balance that exists when we do not forget who we are. when we feel connected to that deep sense of knowing. of being. of grace.

we have come to be reminded that we are not broken. and we never were. that we are not too much. and we never were. that we are not bad. and we never were. we have come to be reminded that shame is not who we are. we have come to be reminded that guilt is not who we are. we have come to be reminded that pain is not who we are. though it may be with us. it may be within us. it may feel like the loudest thing in the room. but it is not the only thing in the room.

we have come to be reminded that the body has memory. and that the body has intelligence. and that this body, right here, the one we are in right now, this one is worth loving. this one is worth listening to. this one is worth dancing with. this one is worth forgiving. this one is worth remembering. this one is worth remembering. this one is worth remembering.
