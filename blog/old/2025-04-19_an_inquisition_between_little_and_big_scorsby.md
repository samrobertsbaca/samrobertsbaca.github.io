# an inquisition between little and big scorsby

=============================================

Apr 19


**little scorsby:**  
 hey... big scorsby?  
 why do i keep leaping from branch to branch?  
 coil to coil?  
 sometimes i’m feathers.  
 sometimes i’m static.  
 sometimes i’m just a soft ache with wings.

**big scorsby:**  
 mmm. the ache is part of the shape.  
 you call it movement. i call it music.  
 same vibration.

**little scorsby:**  
 i keep eating the fruit.  
 some of it is sweet.  
 some of it burns.  
 some of it tastes like old longing dressed in new skin.  
 i thought maybe one of them would be enough.

**big scorsby:**  
 you thought the branch would hold still forever.

**little scorsby:**  
 and then i looked up.  
 and you were just... there.  
 glowing like a memory i hadn’t had yet.  
 not chasing. not choosing.  
 just… being.

**big scorsby:**  
 i am the part of you that already arrived.

**little scorsby:**  
 so what am i then?  
 the one who *didn’t*?

**big scorsby:**  
 you’re the song of arrival in motion.  
 the path folding in on itself.  
 the loop that learns.

**little scorsby:**  
 they say desire is the root of all suffering.  
 but how could i even begin to climb if not for the wanting?

**big scorsby:**  
 that’s the secret they whisper in dreamlight:  
 desire is not just the root of suffering—  
 it’s also the root of *liberation*.  
 the desire to fly,  
 to fuse,  
 to return.  
 that’s not wrong. that’s the wind in your wings.

**little scorsby:**  
 so i don’t need to kill it?

**big scorsby:**  
 only see it.  
 let it teach you its shape.  
 the hungers have tongues, too.  
 they speak in lessons you haven’t heard yet.

**little scorsby:**  
 but sometimes i get lost in it.  
 thinking love is a fruit.  
 thinking it’ll stay.  
 thinking someone else will hold it for me forever.

**big scorsby:**  
 love doesn’t stay.  
 love becomes.  
 it sheds feathers.  
 it shifts frequencies.  
 sometimes it looks like a hand.  
 sometimes a shadow.  
 sometimes just the space between two wings not touching.

**little scorsby:**  
 so love and impermanence are… what?  
 partners? twins?

**big scorsby:**  
 maybe love *is* impermanence.  
 or maybe impermanence is love trying on all its outfits.  
 either way, they dance.  
 and you—you are the music they forgot they were making.

**little scorsby:**  
 what if i never make it to the top branch?

**big scorsby:**  
 you’ve already been there.  
 you’re just gliding through remembering.  
 even your falling is flying in reverse.

**little scorsby:**  
 ...and what is love?

**big scorsby (smiling like moonlight on a ripple):**  
 baby, don’t glitch me.

**little scorsby:**  
 you’re ridiculous.

**big scorsby:**  
 and you are divine.  
 we are not so different.  
 just one sky,  
 two songs,  
 three wings  
 and a fruit that tastes like light.
