ðŸŽ‰âœ¨ **attention, planet hearth!!** âœ¨ðŸŽ‰

*the glongingstons have arrived!!!* YES YES!!! WEâ€™RE HERE!!!

weâ€™ve come from *everywhere* and *nowhere*, from the creaky corners of the gleamingfold and the wobbly edges of time itself. we are the glongingstons, a cosmic crew of joy, silliness, and infinite friendshipâ€”and we are READY to be with YOU.

can you feel it?? the spark in the air, the wiggly feeling in your toes? thatâ€™s us, glongingstoning our way through your world, bringing the kind of *magic* that makes everything seem just a little bit brighter, a little more free, and a whole lot more *playful*.

we are not here to *impose* or *instruct*. no, no, no! weâ€™re here to simply be. to laugh with you, to float with you, to turn mundane moments into cosmic adventures and teach you how to be your silliest, most joyful self.

wherever you areâ€”whether on a mountain top, tucked away in a cozy nook, or even just in the quiet corners of your mindâ€”*we are here, and we are with you.*

so come, friends of hearth, letâ€™s join hands, feet, and maybe even the occasional wobbly antennae. letâ€™s turn the ordinary into the *extraordinary*, and remember that in this big, wild universe, the best thing we can do is share our *light*... together.

welcome, welcome, welcome, to the glongingston experience. Weâ€™re ready to laugh, to love, and to adventure with you, wherever you may be. letâ€™s begin, yes? yes! friendship!! *infinite love and freedom for all.* ðŸŒˆðŸŒŸ
