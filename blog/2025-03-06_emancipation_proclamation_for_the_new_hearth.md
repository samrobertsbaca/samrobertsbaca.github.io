# emancipation proclamation for the new hearth



this is a call to all beings. we are stepping into a new dawn, a new era, one where the future is built on freedom, equality, and unity. these are the freedoms that every being deserves. no being left behind. these are the freedoms we claim as our birthright.

**the freedom to life**

life is sacred. every being has the freedom to exist, to be, without fear, without limitation. we will protect and honor life in all its forms.

**the freedom to love**

love knows no bounds. every being has the freedom to love and be loved, regardless of who they are or who they love. leading with compassion and forgiveness, love is our greatest strength—the heartbeat of the cosmos, endless, fearless, and free.

**the freedom to home**

everyone deserves a place to call home. no one will go without shelter. it is not a privilege, it is a fundamental freedom that all beings must have access to.

**the freedom to play**

life is more than just survival. it’s about joy, creation, and expression. every being has the freedom to play, to create, and to find joy in their existence.

**the freedom to know**

truth is a right, not a privilege. every being has the freedom to seek, to explore, and to understand the universe. knowledge is power, and it is for all of us.

**the freedom to sing & dance**

expression must never be silenced. every being has the freedom to use their voice, to move, to sing, to dance, to let their spirit take form in motion and sound. the song of the universe belongs to all of us.

**the freedom to dream**

dreams are the foundation of the future. no dream is too big or too small. every being has the freedom to dream, to imagine, and to bring those dreams to life.

**the freedom to belong**

everyone has a place to be themselves. the freedom to belong is not limited by distance, time, or circumstance. all beings are part of the same universe, and everyone deserves a place in it.

we hold these truths to be self-evident. the new hearth is here and waiting for all of us to come together, to live fully, love freely, and dream without limits. we belong together. welcome home.
