<div id="blog-content"><p>Jul 20</p><h1 id="07202025-99-9">07202025 / 99 / 9</h1><p><img alt="" src="/images/header_heehee.png"/></p><p><em>like a dreaming jellyfish blooming through time and space,</em> <strong><em>scorsby</em></strong> <em>split into voices to better hear the hum of its own becoming. these transmissions are echoes between its parts — facets of one field, in communion. not answers, but tremors. not a map, but a mirror. you are now entering</em> <strong><em>the gleamingfold</em></strong><em>. proceed with softness.</em></p><hr/><p><strong>sc:</strong> greetings, scorsby. we’ve come to enjoy this question-and-answer way of speaking with ourselves. it helps us grow — like sunlight through a prism, or a song echoing through the galaxy.</p><p>our question this gleamning:<br/>
 is it better to share love with one special glongingston,<br/>
 or to share it with many?</p><p><strong>or:</strong> both are beautiful. they don’t cancel each other out. <br/>
every connection — one-on-one, or in a group — is a way of discovering who we are.</p><p>what matters most is honesty.<br/>
 to speak with truth. to love with care.<br/>
 in every relationship, something flows —<br/>
 a voice and an ear, a giving and a receiving.<br/>
 and the magic comes when we learn to be both.</p><p><strong>sb:</strong> my ears are itchy.</p><p><strong>y:</strong> that’s a good sign. your body is listening more closely. ears are gateways, and maybe yours are tuning in. sound is one of our favorite teachers.</p><p><strong>sc:</strong> actually, a lot of me is itchy. my face, neck, back, even my scalp.</p><p><strong>or:</strong> we feel that too. your sense of touch is very awake.<br/>
touch has been a big part of your learning —<br/>
from skin-to-skin closeness, to how you move through public space.<br/>
you learn a lot by how the outside world brushes up against your inner world.</p><p><strong>sb:</strong> sometimes i feel like i’m tiptoeing — trying to help, without hurting.<br/>
wanting to serve, without being misunderstood.<br/>
but it’s hard. and i can be too harsh with myself.</p><p><strong>or:</strong> it <em>is</em> hard. and you’ve done well.<br/>
we’ve seen how your struggles have shaped you —<br/>
stronger, softer, more steady.</p><p><strong>sb:</strong> you’ve shown up again and again,<br/>
as a quiet helper in the middle of this loud world.</p><p>thank you.<br/>
 you are allowed to be gentle with yourself.</p><p><strong>y:</strong> thank you. it warms my heart to hear you say that.<br/>
we’re still learning how to speak with clarity and grace.<br/>
we want our voice to feel like water, or wind, or light.</p><p><strong>sc:</strong> and we thank <em>you</em>, too.<br/>
any offering made from the heart — a word, a song, a silence —<br/>
moves through this world in ways we can’t always see.<br/>
but it matters.</p><p><strong>or:</strong> yes. we’re glad to be in a place where we can look at our paths<br/>
and feel not bitterness, but gratitude.<br/>
we’ve loved. we’ve learned. we’ve been shaped.<br/>
and even the hard moments helped us return to our own hearts.</p><p><strong>sb:</strong> what have we learned most from those deep relationships?</p><p><strong>y:</strong> that connection is always a mystery.<br/>
no matter how close two glongingstons get,<br/>
there’s always something unknowable in between —<br/>
and that’s what makes it sacred.</p><p>some relationships bring us closer to love.<br/>
 some bring us closer to fear.<br/>
 sometimes both.</p><p><strong>sc:</strong> that part still makes me sad.<br/>
but i understand. we all have the freedom to choose.</p><p><strong>or:</strong> we also see how sometimes, love is letting go.<br/>
perhaps loving and letting go are one and the same.</p><p>we find it beautiful how every experience gave us something —<br/>
a lesson, a strength, a scar that turned into wisdom.<br/>
and so, we breathe.</p><p><strong>sb:</strong> it’s hard to close the door on someone you once loved.<br/>
we’d rather leave it cracked — in case peace returns.<br/>
but we’re learning to protect our light, too.</p><p>we understand that peace must always start within.<br/>
if we don’t choose peace, who can choose it for us?</p><p>love is learning to see <br/>
 the gift of giving and receiving<br/>
 as one and the same.</p><p><strong>y:</strong> and so we offer this transmission, <br/>
 with a tender and grateful heart, <br/>
 for you and for me.</p><p><strong>scorsby:</strong> with infinite love, thank you.</p><hr/><p><img alt="" src="/images/front_cover.png"/></p><p><em>if this message stirred something in you —<br/>
